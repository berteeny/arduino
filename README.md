# Arduino

This is the first iteration of an ongoing project using an Arduino esp32 device and a simple Node.js server, which can be found [here](https://github.com/berteeny/arduino-node). 

In its first iteration, this code runs a flashing led sequence, controlled by the user via a simple web app.

More iterations using different devices to come!

## Usage

The Arduino IDE is best to run this code with the esp32 device.
